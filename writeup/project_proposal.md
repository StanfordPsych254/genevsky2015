One major aspect of my research is to explore whether neural affective measures can predict market level behavior in various market contexts. One important result that forms the basis of this research program is the finding that affective ratings about products collected from online samples are predictive of consumption at the market level. In particular, Genevsky & Knutson (2015) found that affective ratings about the face photographs included in microloan requests are predictive of the success of the microloans on Kiva. I propose to replicate this finding from the internet study in Genevsky & Knutson (2015).

To conduct this replication, I will use the Kiva API to collect a novel sample of microloan stimuli. Then, I will generate a website using javascript and HTML to obtain MTurker ratings on the affective content of the photos associated with each of the microloan requests. Participants will be recruited and paid via the MTurk platform. The main challenge will be data management, since there will be a relatively large pool of stimuli.
