##Introduction

This is a replication of the Internet study described in Genevsky & Knutson (2015). The original study asked about the relative contribution of different features of microloan requests to funding success. The study focused on affective features and modality, including the affective quality of the faces of the microloan recipients, and the text used in the description. The original paper found that affective ratings of microloan recipient faces in an independent Internet sample could be used to predict the rate at which a microloan received funding. Thus, the result I aim to replicate is the significant linear effect of rated facial positive arousal on the aggregate funding rate.


##Methods

Participants are asked to view 20 images and rate each of them on the following dimensions: how clear the image is, affective valence, affective arousal, discrete emotion, emotion intensity, and neediness.

###Power Analysis

The original analysis was a mixed-effects model, so it is not straightforward to devise an exact power analysis. Instead, I used simulation on the original data, by running the primary analysis of interest on random (without replacement) smaller subsamples of the data, where a "success" is a significant coefficient on the positive arousal regressor, I found that I could obtain power of 0.80 using random samples of 2800 images.

I conducted a sweep using different sample sizes of images by modifying `nsubjs` in the code below and simulating 1000 samples:

```{r power test}

## load outcome data
dana1 <- read.csv("kiva_aggdata.csv")

nsubjs=2800
nsamps=1000;
successes=0; ## start at zero
for(i in 1:nsamps){
  ## sample 
  subsamp=sample(7000,nsubjs)
  mod1 <- lmer(logdollarhour ~ scale(per_posemo) + scale(per_negemo) + scale(pa_orig) + scale(na_orig) + 
                 scale(cansee_orig) + scale(need_orig) + 
                 scale(total_words_in_description) + 
                 scale(loan_amount) + scale(terms_2_repayment_term) +
                 gender + (1|sector) + (1|location_3_country_code), data=dana1[subsamp,])
  ## count successes
  if(summary(mod1)$coefficients[4,5]<0.05){ ## coefficient on positive arousal
    successes=successes+1;
  }
}
success=successes/nsamps
print(paste("Proportion of successes: ",success))

```

###Planned Sample

Planned sample size is 2800 images, at 20 images per subject, this requires a sample of 140 subjects.

###Materials

"We acquired extensive data on microloan outcomes from Kiva Microfunds (www.kiva.org), an Internet-based international microfinance organization. Kiva’s Web site allows users to offer small financial loans to individuals in need. Loans are funded in $25 increments but are received by the borrower only if the requested amount is successfully raised within 30 days of the initial loan request. We first used the Kiva application programming interface to sample 144,769 loan requests from those posted during the 2012 calendar year, the most recent period that could ensure complete loan-outcome results at the time of initial analyses. We then excluded loan requests with multiple borrowers (remaining n = 127,811), to minimize heterogeneity in photograph ratings arising from variations in the size of the borrower group; loan requests without text (remaining n = 120,130), because they could not be scored with respect to affective words in the text; (c) loan requests that were fully funded within the last 3 days of eligibility (remaining n = 109,454), to limit potential confounds due to shifts in lender’s motiva- tions and behavior as the deadline for loan expiration approached; and (d) loan requests with additional miss- ing data points (remaining n = 91,858). Of the remaining 91,858 loan requests, 13,500 were randomly sampled for analysis (i.e., 7,000 funded and 6,500 not funded)."

Note that while the original study included 7000 microloans that were funded, we are randomly sampling a subset of 2800 images from the original stimulus set. The subset will not be preselected (as MTurk participants accept the HIT, samples of images will be taken without replacement from the superset).

###Procedure	

"The affective impact of the loan-request photographs was estimated by soliciting independent ratings on Ama- zon’s Mechanical Turk. All raters gave informed consent prior to participating. Each rater viewed a randomly selected photograph extracted from one of the Kiva loan requests and then evaluated the photograph on 7-point scales indexing the affective valence and arousal sig- naled by the person’s facial expression, the photograph’s identifiability (or visual clarity), and the person’s per- ceived neediness. A forced-choice question then asked raters to categorize the emotion displayed (i.e., whether the person was happy, sad, calm, fearful, angry, dis- gusted, etc.; see Fig. S1 in the Supplemental Material). To ensure that ratings referred only to the photographs and not other details on the loan-request pages, we pre- sented the photographs alone, removed from the con- text of the loan requests."

###Analysis Plan

The key analysis is as follows:

We will conduct a mixed model using random intercepts for sector, and location country code, corresponding to the regression table presented in Table 1 of the original manuscript. The dependent variable will be the logarithm of the rate at which a microloan gets funded. The fixed effects will include: positive emotion words in the description, negative emotion words in the description, positive arousal, negative arousal, clarity of the image, perceived neediness, number of words in loan description, loan amount requested, repayment term, and requestee gender.

This model structure is identical to the analysis in the original study, which was used in the power analysis above.

A successful replication would require a significant (positive) coefficient on positive arousal.

###Differences from Original Study

One important difference is that in the current replication, participants are explicitly asked to make 20 ratings, while in the original study, participants could choose to rate between 1 and 50 loan request images.

The analysis also uses one MTurker rating per image, rather than two MTurker ratings per image.

Finally, I added zero variance responses as an exclusion criterion, which was not an exclusion criterion in the original study.

These differences are not anticipated to have an effect on the main result.

###Data Preparation

####Import data

## load mturk json files

  for (i in files){
    data[[length(data)+1]]=fromJSON(paste(f,"/production-results-anonymized-results/",i,sep=""))
  }
}

#### Data exclusion / filtering

# find subjects who responded with zero variance on any question
mturkdata_var = mturkdata %>%

# keep subjects with nonzero variance
mturkdata=mturkdata[!(mturkdata$subj %in% subj_ex),]

#### Prepare data for analysis - create columns etc.

## combine MTurk ratings with out of sample data, drop rows for images that were not rated on MTurk
merged_data=full_join(mturkdata,dana1) %>%
  filter(!is.na(subj))

## generate positive arousal and negative arousal variables, these should be ipsatized, following Knutson, Katovich, & Suri (TICS 2014), but in the original table in the paper they are not
merged_data = merged_data %>%
  group_by(subj) %>% 
  mutate(val_ip=as.numeric(scale(valence,scale=F)),aro_ip=as.numeric(scale(arousal,scale=F)),see_ip=as.numeric(scale(cansee,scale=F)),need_ip=as.numeric(scale(need,scale=F))) %>% # ipsatize variables

### Confirmatory analysis

The main analysis to replicate in the original paper was the significant positive coefficient on positive arousal in Table 1. Figure 2b in the original paper provides a visualization of this result. The original figure together with a version using the replication data are also presented below.

## Discussion

### Summary of Replication Attempt

Open the discussion section with a paragraph summarizing the primary result from the confirmatory analysis and the assessment of whether it replicated, partially replicated, or failed to replicate the original result.  

### Commentary

Add open-ended commentary (if any) reflecting (a) insights from follow-up exploratory analysis, (b) assessment of the meaning of the replication (or not) - e.g., for a failure to replicate, are the differences between original and present study ones that definitely, plausibly, or are unlikely to have been moderators of the result, and (c) discussion of any objections or challenges raised by the current and original authors about the replication attempt.  None of these need to be long.
